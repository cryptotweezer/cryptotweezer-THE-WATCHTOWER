🧠 AI COLLABORATION WORKFLOW (workflow.md)
🔴 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:

READ this file at the start of every session.

STRICT SCOPE: Only work on the "Current Focus".

UPDATE: You MUST update "Recent Accomplishments" before every commit.

🚦 CURRENT PHASE
Phase 1: The Watchtower (Homepage & Reactive UI) Target: Build the Gatekeeper, the HUD, and the Threat Phase Engine.

📝 RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS (The "Done" List)
✅ Core Architecture: All Master Plans and Protocols initialized in .claude/skills/.

✅ Universal AI Alignment: agents.md configured to point all agents to the modular skill set.

✅ Project Context: Shifted from "Sandboxes" to "Integrated Honeypot" vision.

✅ Tech Stack Verification: Next.js 15/16, Arcjet, and Drizzle standards defined.

🚧 CURRENT FOCUS (Active Work)
Goal: Initialize the "Gatekeeper" experience on the Homepage.

Active Task: Implementing the Handshake Animation (2-second loading sequence with scrolling logs) before revealing the terminal.

📋 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS (The Queue)
Gatekeeper Handshake: Create the overlay and the "Decryption/Handshake" animation triggers.

HUD Telemetry: Bind Arcjet metadata (VPN, IP Reputation, OS) to the HUD components in the Homepage.

Threat Phase Engine: Implement the global state (Alpha/Bravo/Charlie) and CSS transitions (Cyan/Amber/Red Glitch).

Sentinel-02 Personality: Update the AI prompt to react to user navigation and detected threats.

⛔ OUT OF SCOPE (Do Not Touch)
Do NOT touch the war-room or infamy-engine logic yet.

Do NOT perform Neon DB migrations until the Homepage UI is 100% reactive.

Do NOT change the theme colors outside of the Alpha/Bravo/Charlie specification.
