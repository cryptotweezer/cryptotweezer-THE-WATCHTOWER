Headline: SYSTEM OVERVIEW: THE WATCHTOWER
Module 01 - The Ghost Layer: * The Ghost Layer Technology: A mirrored, non-persistent environment designed to intercept and study attacker behavior. It creates a tactical illusion, allowing the system to analyze threats without exposing the secure infrastructure.
Module 02 - Proactive Defense: * Adaptive Perimeter Control: Unlike traditional firewalls, The Watchtower doesn't just block. It observes, fingerprints, and reacts dynamically to behavioral anomalies.
Module 03 - Resident Intelligence: * Autonomous Surveillance: A dedicated neural layer monitors every request, providing real-time commentary and active countermeasures against intrusion attempts.

4. LIVE FEED (AI Observational Console)
A terminal window that reacts to user actions.
Input Status: [ LOCKED ] Synchronization required for command uplink.
Sample AI Logs:
[AI] Connection established. Node located. Don't make it boring.
[AI] Navigation to /about detected. Analyzing interest level...
[AI] Warning: Unauthorized attempt to access /admin. Interesting technique. Try harder.

5. THREAT PHASES (Visual Reactions)
PHASE ALPHA (Cian/Green): Quiet observation. Interface is stable.
PHASE BRAVO (Amber/Orange): Suspicious activity detected (DevTools open / Sensitive routes). HUD borders start to pulse.
PHASE CHARLIE (Neon Red/Glitch): Active combat mode. Triggered by SQLi or Rate Limiting. AI attitude shifts to "Let's play".
