THE WATCHTOWER: HOMEPAGE MASTER PLAN (v1.1)
1. THE GATEKEEPER (Initial Overlay)
Visual State: Overlays the blurred HUD/Terminal background.

Headline: ACCESS RESTRICTED: PERIMETER MONITORING ACTIVE

Security Disclaimer: "By entering The Watchtower, you acknowledge that your digital signature, network metadata, and behavioral patterns will be analyzed in real-time. This is a live security environment designed for defensive intelligence gathering."

Action Button: [ INITIALIZE HANDSHAKE ]

Handshake Animation: Upon clicking, show a 2-second loading sequence with scrolling logs: SCANNING FINGERPRINT..., MAPPING NODE..., ENCRYPTING DOWNLINK.... Fade out the overlay with a digital "flicker" effect.

2. THE HUD (Main Identity Node)
Map Arcjet telemetry to the following fields:

Node Identity: ID: [Fingerprint_Hash]

Threat Level: STATUS: [ALPHA | BRAVO | CHARLIE] (Color-coded).

Trust Score: HUMAN CONFIDENCE: [98% - 0%] (Decreases based on suspicious activity).

Deep Scan Metadata:

OS/Engine: Map User-Agent (e.g., Windows / Chrome).

Network: VPN/Proxy: [DETECTED | CLEAN].

Security: Incognito Mode: [ACTIVE | INACTIVE].

Reputation: IP Reputation: [CLEAN | SUSPICIOUS | BLACKLISTED].

3. THE BRIEFING (Information Section)
Module 01 - The Ghost Layer: A mirrored, non-persistent environment designed to study attacker behavior without exposing secure infrastructure.

Module 02 - Proactive Defense: Adaptive perimeter control that observes, fingerprints, and reacts to behavioral anomalies.

Module 03 - Resident Intelligence: Autonomous neural layer (Sentinel-02) monitoring requests with real-time commentary and active countermeasures.

4. LIVE FEED (AI Observational Console)
Input Status: [ LOCKED ] Synchronization required for command uplink. (Displayed above text input).

Interaction Triggers: Sentinel-02 reacts to:

Prolonged Scrolling: "Analyzing interest level in defense modules..."

Inactivity: "Still there, Node [ID]? Silence usually precedes intrusion."

Route Probing: Reacts to attempts on /admin, /api, etc.

5. THREAT PHASES (Visuals & Logic)
PHASE ALPHA (Cyan/Stable): Default state. Sentinel is professional/cynic.

PHASE BRAVO (Amber/Suspicious): * Trigger: DevTools Open OR access attempts to sensitive paths (/admin, /.env).

Visual: Amber borders (#FFBF00). Pulsing HUD.

Sentinel Mood: Mocking. "Curiosity killed the node."

PHASE CHARLIE (Neon Red/Combat): * Trigger: SQLi/XSS payloads detected OR Rate Limit exceeded (>10 req/sec).

Visual: Glitch effect (CRT flicker). Red borders (#FF0000). UI vibration.

Sentinel Mood: Aggressive. "Logging signature in the Hall of Infamy."

🕵️‍♂️ Antigravity Deployment Protocol:
"Antigravity, your objective is to reach 100% completion of homepage.md. Do not proceed to 'The War Room' or 'The Hall of Infamy' until the following checklist is verified:

Gatekeeper: Finalize the 2-second handshake animation and transition.

HUD Mapping: Bind Arcjet metadata (VPN, OS, Reputation) to the UI components.

Phase State Engine: Implement a global state for Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie phases with corresponding CSS transitions.

Security Sensors: Implement the DevTools Detection and Fake Route Interceptor to trigger Phase Bravo.

Sentinel Awareness: Update the System Prompt in route.ts to include the currentPhase context so the AI adapts its personality.

Mandatory: Confirm with a 'HOMEPAGE DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE' status once all features are live and functional in the production environment. Execute one task at a time."
