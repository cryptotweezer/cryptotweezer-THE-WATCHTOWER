Socio, este es el documento más importante de todos. Es el "GPS" del proyecto. Si el contexto está desactualizado, la IA empezará a construir cosas que ya no queremos (como los sandboxes aburridos) en lugar de la experiencia de "Honeypot" real que definimos hoy.

He reescrito el project-context.md para que refleje la nueva visión: The Watchtower, el Sentinel-02, y la transición de un "sitio de aprendizaje" a un "Activo de Defensa Activa".

Aquí tienes la versión Ultra-Clean y actualizada:

🌍 PROJECT CONTEXT: DIGITAL TWIN III - THE WATCHTOWER (v1.1)
The Mission: "Active Defense & Intelligence Gathering." We are transforming a professional portfolio into a Cyber-Hardened Infrastructure Node. The system is not just a showcase; it is a live laboratory that detects, logs, and mocks adversaries in real-time.

🏛️ CORE VISION: THE SENTINEL'S PERIMETER
The Experience: The site acts as a "living" entity (Sentinel-02).

The Hook: Every visitor is analyzed. "Normal" users see a high-end tech portfolio; "Adversaries" trigger a system-wide defensive reaction.

The Twist: We don't use boring sandboxes. The entire application is a Honeypot. Every attack attempt is fuel for the Global Telemetry.

🛡️ FUNCTIONAL MODULES (THE ECOSYSTEM)
The Watchtower (Homepage): The entry point. Features the "Gatekeeper" handshake and real-time identity scanning (IP, Fingerprint, Geolocation).

The War Room (Global Dashboard): A command center showing the "Global Stress Level," real-time attack maps, and a live feed of neutralized threats.

The Hall of Infamy (Leaderboard): A gamified ranking of the most persistent "Criminals" (attackers), ranked by their Infamy Score.

The Ghost Layer: Deceptive logic that intercepts suspicious routes (/admin, .env) to feed attackers fake data while logging their behavior.

🕹️ THREAT PHASES (REACTION SYSTEM)
PHASE ALPHA (Stable): Standard operation. Cyan aesthetics. Sentinel is observant.

PHASE BRAVO (Suspicious): Triggered by DevTools or probing. Amber aesthetics. Sentinel becomes sarcastic.

PHASE CHARLIE (Combat): Triggered by SQLi, XSS, or Rate Limiting. Red Glitch aesthetics. Sentinel becomes aggressive and tactical.

🛡️ SIX-LAYER DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE
Public Interface: Next.js 15+ (App Router). Zero-trust input handling.

App Logic: Server Actions with strict validation. No client-side DB exposure.

Sentinel AI: GPT-4o-mini via Vercel AI SDK. Manual streaming for a "terminal" feel. Personality: Cold, authoritative, and cynical.

Data Integrity: Neon Postgres + Drizzle ORM. Immutable logs for security events.

Network Defense: Arcjet WAF is the primary enforcer (Bot detection, Rate Limiting, SQLi/XSS protection).

Observability: Real-time telemetry visualized in "The War Room."

🛠️ TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS (FREE TIER OPTIMIZED)
Framework: Next.js 15.1+ (App Router).

Database: Neon Postgres (Serverless/Free Tier).

Security: Arcjet (WAF & Shield).

AI: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) + Vercel AI SDK.

Deployment: Vercel (Edge Functions).

🕵️‍♂️ SOCIO-AI SYNERGY: HOW TO USE THIS CONTEXT
Antigravity must use this document as the Ultimate Source of Truth. Any feature request must be cross-referenced with the "Threat Phases" and "Free Tier Optimization" sections.

Current Focus: Completion of The Watchtower (Homepage) including the transition logic for Phase Bravo and Charlie.
