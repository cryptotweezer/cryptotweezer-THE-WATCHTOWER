🛰️ THE WATCHTOWER: DIGITAL TWIN III
"live threat-hunting node."

The Watchtower is an Active Defense & SecOps Infrastructure designed to serve as the "Boss Final" for any attacker. Unlike static sites, this platform breathes, monitors, and reacts. It captures real-time attack telemetry, analyzes threat patterns with AI, and dissects adversary persistence through a high-fidelity deception system.

🏛️ THE VISION (RE-ENGINEERED)
The project functions as an Infamy Laboratory. We don't just teach security; we enforce it. The system classifies visitors into two authorization levels based on their intent and footprint:

The Adversary: Hackers, scripts, and the curious. They face a hostile perimeter managed by Sentinel-02 (the resident AI). They must earn their status by bypassing logic and memory traps to reach a 100% Risk Score.

The Authorized Observer (Recruiter): Activated via the ?clearance=RECRUITER parameter. The system enters Briefing Mode, revealing the underlying technical architecture, stack details, and engineering processes behind the shield.

🛡️ ACTIVE DEFENSE MODULES
The Terminal (Home): Forensic HUD featuring Deep Scan metadata, DevTools detection, and the Infamy Engine.

The War Room (Dashboard): Command center with global threat heatmaps, real-time traffic pulses, and a dynamic Stress Meter.

The Triple Lock (Honeypots):

Binary-Ghost: Client-side memory tampering trap via JS Proxy.

Shadow-Field: API Over-posting detection (JSON attribute injection).

Ghost-Key: Social engineering bait hidden within source code comments.

The Ghost Layer: A UI Hijack system triggered by critical intrusions. It replaces standard error pages (404s) with a corrupted interface and persistent visual counter-attacks.

Wall of Infamy: An immutable "deface" wall where only Adversaries who reach 100% Risk can leave their permanent signature.

🤖 AI-HUMAN COLLABORATION (.claude/skills)
This repository is optimized for AI-assisted development. We use a Modular Skills system to ensure that any agent (Sentinel-02, Cursor, or Gemini) maintains total project consistency.

🧠 project-context.md: The "brain" of the Sentinel and product vision.

🚨 ai-protocol.md: Security and quality gates for code generation.

📜 archivist.md: Immutable historical log maintained in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md.

🛠️ THE ELITE STACK
Core: Next.js 15+ (App Router, Server Actions).

Shield: Arcjet (WAF, Bot Detection, Fingerprinting, Rate Limiting).

Data: Neon Postgres (Serverless) + Drizzle ORM (Type-safe Logs).

Intelligence: Vercel AI SDK (Sentinel-02 Personality Engine).

Deployment: Vercel Edge Runtime (Low-latency Active Defense).
