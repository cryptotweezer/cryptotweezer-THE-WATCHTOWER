# 🛰️ THE WATCHTOWER: DIGITAL TWIN III

> "Defensive Teacher: Learn by Attacking."

The Watchtower is a next-generation **SecOps & Active Defense Platform**. It is not just a portfolio; it is a self-defending infrastructure node that captures real-time attack telemetry, analyzes threat patterns with AI, and gamifies the experience for both security researchers and adversaries.

---

## 🏛️ CORE VISION

The project implements a **Live Honeypot** architecture. It classifies visitors into two profiles:

*   **The Apprentice**: Receives AI-driven mentorship and forensic reports on security vulnerabilities.
*   **The Adversary**: Faces a hardened perimeter that logs every payload, fingerprints their identity, and assigns "Infamy Points" for their attempts.

---

## 🛡️ ACTIVE DEFENSE MODULES

*   **The Watchtower (Homepage)**: Real-time HUD showing the visitor's risk score, fingerprint metadata, and the current system threat level (Alpha/Bravo/Charlie).
*   **The War Room (Global Dashboard)**: A command center visualizing global attack heatmaps and live incident feeds across the infrastructure.
*   **The Ghost Layer (Deceptive Logic)**: Intercepts probes to sensitive routes (`/admin`, `.env`) to feed attackers fake data while silently logging their signatures.
*   **The Hall of Infamy (Gamification)**: A competitive leaderboard ranking the most persistent "Threat Actors" based on their detected activities.

## 🤖 AI-FIRST ARCHITECTURE ("AGENT SKILLS")

This repository is optimized for **AI-Human Collaboration**. We use a modular context system located in `.claude/skills/` to ensure all agents (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini) act with perfect consistency.

**Key Skills:**

*   🧠 `project-context.md`: The "Vision Engine" and Sentinel-02 persona.
*   🚨 `ai-protocol.md`: Strict session management and quality gates.
*   📜 `archivist.md`: Mandatory history logging in `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
*   🏗️ `tech-stack-*.md`: Standards for Next.js 15+, Drizzle, and Arcjet WAF.

---

## 🛠️ THE SECURITY STACK

*   **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router / Server Actions).
*   **Perimeter**: Arcjet WAF (Bot Detection, Rate Limiting, SQLi/XSS Protection).
*   **Database**: Neon Postgres (Serverless) + Drizzle ORM (Type-safe, immutable logs).
*   **Intelligence**: Vercel AI SDK (Sentinel-02 Forensic Analysis).
*   **Infrastructure**: Vercel (Optimized for high performance and zero cost).
